    <p><strong>Status:</strong> Early stages of testing. ~ 2 month ETA</progress></p>

    <p>
      This chase light is being developed as a direct third brake light replacement for the 13th generation Ford F-150 (2015â€“2020).
      It's designed to fit cleanly into the stock opening while offering a unique look and added utility with amber LED pods.
    </p>

    <p>
      Current goals include a precise universal fit across trims and cab styles, heat- and UV-resistant ASA construction, and 
      a simple bolt-on install with minimal wiring. The design is being tested and iterated for strength, sealing, and long-term durability.
    </p>

    <p><em>More updates will be posted as testing continues. Stay tuned.</em></p>
