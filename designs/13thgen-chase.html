    <p>
      This chase light is being developed as a direct third brake light replacement for the 13th generation Ford F‑150 (2015–2020).
      It's designed to fit cleanly into the stock opening while offering a unique look and added utility with amber LED pods.

      <h3>Status Update</h3>
      <p>
        Development for the 13th Gen F‑150 Chase Light is underway. The current CAD model is based on a single set of measurements taken from a friend’s truck, and the first test fit is expected to take place within the next 1–2 weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the general housing shape and mounting layout are in place, this initial prototype will help confirm key dimensions such as overall width, mounting locations, and clearance to factory trim contours. Once validated, I’ll begin refining the fit and finalizing features like lens angles, gasket channeling, and LED pod alignment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ultimate goal is a clean replacement for the OEM third brake light — one that preserves the stock wiring functionality while adding chase pods for rear-facing visibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Look for updates to this page after the test fit, where I’ll share pictures and outline any necessary changes. Pre-orders are not yet open until design is optimized and fitment confirmed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks for your interest and patience — more soon.
