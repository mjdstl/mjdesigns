    <p>3D printed center cap inspired by Method Race Wheels. Precision fit and clean styling. CAD-modeled and tested for secure hub engagement. This will be offered as a free STL or optionally printed in-house and shipped. Designed to offer an inexpensive alternative to replacing your center cap.</p>

      <h3>Status Update</h3>
      <p>
        This 304-style center cap is currently being optimized to fit a variety of hub bore diameters beyond the original 108mm Method sizing. The goal is to make the design flexible and accessible for more vehicle/wheel setups without sacrificing secure fitment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The outer shell geometry is complete, and I’m currently testing multiple versions to verify snap-in retention, depth, and tolerance when printed in different filaments like PETG and ASA. I’m also refining the inner groove that accepts a compression-fit o-ring for extra grip.
      </p>
      <p>
        This part will be offered as a purchaseable STL download via Cults3d, or optionally printed and shipped for those without 3D printers. If you’re interested in a specific bore size, feel free to reach out and I may be able to size it for your setup.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Method logo shown in some preview images is for reference only and will likely be excluded from the shared STL due to trademark concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Estimated availability for final STL and/or first batch of prints is **around 6 weeks** depending on final test prints and demand.
