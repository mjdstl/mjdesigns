      This chase light is being designed as a third brake light replacement for the 1997 Ford F‑250 with the 7.3L Power Stroke diesel.
      The design is currently in prototype phase and awaiting test‑fitment due to limited access to the vehicle.

      <h3>Status Update</h3>
      <p>
        The 1997 F‑250 Chase Light project is still in its early concept stage. I was able to briefly gather measurements from a friend’s 7.3 Power Stroke, which provided the foundation for the current CAD prototype. However, further development is temporarily paused until I can access the truck again for a full test fit.
      </p>
      <p>
        This design is currently the furthest out from completion, as I’m prioritizing the 10th Gen F‑150 Chase Light and 13th Gen F‑150 Chase Light projects first. Once those are wrapped up, I’ll revisit this model with updated measurements and refinement to ensure accurate fitment across similar year‑range F‑Series trucks.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal is to complete another round of measurements within the next few weeks to validate mounting points and housing geometry. After that, I’ll move into test printing and early functional prototypes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for your patience — as a full‑time college student balancing coursework and multiple ongoing projects, I appreciate everyone following along.
