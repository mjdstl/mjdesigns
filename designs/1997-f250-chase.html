    <p>
      This chase light is being designed as a third brake light replacement for the 1997 Ford F‑250 with the 7.3L Power Stroke diesel.
      The design is currently in prototype phase and awaiting test‑fitment due to limited access to the vehicle.

      <h3>Status Update</h3>
      <p>
    The first 1997 F-250 Chase Light prototype has been printed and test-fitted. Fitment was close, but a few adjustments were needed.
     </p>
     <p>
    The CAD model has already been updated based on the test fit results, focusing on mounting alignment and how the housing sits against the cab. A new test-fit print is in progress to confirm those changes.
    </p>
    <p>
    Progress is steady — design revisions and test fits will continue until the fitment and overall design are fully optimized.
   </p>
   <p>
    More updates will be posted here after the next round of testing.
