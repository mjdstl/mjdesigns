      <h2>About MJDesigns</h2>
    </header>

    <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.05rem;">
      MJDesigns is an independent design studio specializing in custom off-road lighting, 
      3D-printed automotive components, and functional engineering solutions. 
      What began as a single-person prototyping effort has grown into a small, focused team 
      dedicated to building clean, reliable, and OEM-inspired products.
    </p>

    <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.05rem;">
      Every MJDesigns product is created through a complete process — 
      from CAD modeling and prototype iteration to real-world testing across Southern California’s 
      deserts, trails, and daily-driving conditions. Each design is developed with durability, 
      fitment, and user experience at the core.
    </p>

    <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.05rem;">
      Our goal is simple: produce dependable, well-designed components that look great, 
      install easily, and improve capability where it matters. Whether you're exploring new terrain or 
      upgrading your build, MJDesigns is committed to delivering parts that perform.
    </p>

    <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.05rem;">
      Thank you for supporting and following the growth of MJDesigns. More designs, upgrades, and 
      refinements are on the way.
